# strict vs dryRun
# Scenario Outline vs Scenario (why do we need to use Scenario outline along with examples)
#does examples work in the same way in jbehave as similar to cucumber like running multiple times according to data
#what is differnece between data, keyword and hybrid driven frameworks
#how to pass data from csv's in cucumber
#how we are able to run multiple config files in mobile framework but not in web framework
#reporting in jbehave and cucumber
#@before and @after are known as hooks in cucumber which will be executing for every scenario in a feature file
#We will be able to mention the tags in cucumber similar to metaTags in jbehave,-
#					-in cucumber this can be done in scenarion level and as well as in feature level also
